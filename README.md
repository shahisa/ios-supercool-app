# Project: Supercool
This is the first app built for iOS. An introductory version of building an app for iOS.  

##User Stories
1. User Presses button for a surprise. 

##Notes
Used a hidden function to allow for surprise. The app is complete there is nothing more I wished to do with this app other than get an intro in using the storyboard, basic function, and buttons usage in Swift.
